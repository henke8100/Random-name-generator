== 2. About Random Name Generator ==
Random Name Generator is a small project created by me, basically to learn how
to create extensions for Google Chrome. Currently, the extension simply add an
item to the context menu that allows the user to fill any <input> / <textarea>
elements with a random name.

==3. How to contibrute==
To contibrute, simply submit a pull request, and I'll probably add it to the
extension, and probably add your name to the contibrutors list.
